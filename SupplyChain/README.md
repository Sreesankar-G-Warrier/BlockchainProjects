# About

  Here we are Architect a Blockchain Supply Chain Solution. In this project we're taking a story of a coffeebean from his farmer to the consumer.
  
# Diagrams

   Here am representing four diagrams. This will help the user to understand how the system works and what are the different functionalities that are implemented in the system.

## *Activity Diagram*

   An activity diagram visually presents a series of actions or flow of control in a system similar to a flowchart or a data flow diagram.

## *Class Diagram*

   A class diagram is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods),        and the relationships among objects.

 ## *Sequence Diagram*
 
  A sequence diagram shows object interactions arranged in time sequence.

 ## *State Diagram*
 
  A state diagram is a diagram used in computer science to describe the behavior of a system considering all the possible states of an object when an event occurs.
